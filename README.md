# redux-plus-rtkQuery-vs-redux-createSlice-Axios

I developed a small web application using two different techniques for managing state and handling API requests: Redux with RTK Query and Redux Toolkit with Axios.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React
- Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- Axios
- json-server as a mock server

| Aspect                        | Redux with RTK Query                           | Redux Toolkit + Axios                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**                | Simpler and more concise.                      | Requires more code and setup.                                           |
| **File Structure**            | Usually just one slice file.                   | Requires separate action, reducer, and API request files.               |
| **State Management**          | Automatically managed by RTK Query.            | Manually managed using reducers.                                        |
| **Action Creation**           | Automatically generated by RTK Query.          | Manually created for each action.                                       |
| **Caching**                   | Built-in caching for API requests.             | Custom caching implementation if needed.                                |
| **Data Fetching**             | Declarative data fetching with queries.        | Imperative Axios calls.                                                 |
| **Redux Toolkit Integration** | Can be used alongside Redux Toolkit.           | Utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management.                            |
| **Error Handling**            | Built-in error handling.                       | Custom error handling.                                                  |
| **Code Organization**         | All logic in one file (slice).                 | Logic distributed across multiple files (actions, reducers, selectors). |
| **Type Safety**               | Strong type safety with generated types.       | Requires manual type annotations.                                       |
| **Learning Curve**            | Easier for beginners due to abstraction.       | More control but steeper learning curve.                                |
| **Maintenance**               | Easier to maintain due to auto-generated code. | Requires more manual maintenance.                                       |

These are general points of comparison, and the choice between the two approaches depends on your project's specific requirements, team expertise, and your personal preferences. RTK Query can be a great choice for quickly building and maintaining applications with minimal boilerplate, while Redux Toolkit + Axios provides more flexibility and control for complex use cases.

To get started with this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-typescript-app.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

4. Start the JSON server:
   npm run db
